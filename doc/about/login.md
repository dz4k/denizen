title: Log in to your blog
---

Most people who visit your website will not be you,
and will have no need to post.
Because of this, the login page isn't openly advertised as it would be on a social media site.

In order to log in, navigate to the page:

  ~~~
  https://<your blog>/.denizen/login
  ~~~

in your browser (replacing `<your blog>` with the address of your blog).

If you've used a CMS like WordPress before,
you might recognize this as similar to the `/wp-admin/` page.

Log in by entering your password
(the one you set on the [welcome page]).

After you log in, your homepage will look a little different:

 * At the top, you'll see the posting interface.
   You can write into the text box and click <kbd>Post</kbd> for a quick text post,
   or click <kbd>Open big editor</kbd> to open the [post editor].

 * At the very bottom of the page,
   you'll see the <kbd>Console</kbd> button that takes you to [settings],
   and the <kbd>Log out</kbd> button.

## Next steps

 * [Make a post](/about/posting)
 * [Edit your profile](/about/profile)
 * [Change your settings](/about/settings)
