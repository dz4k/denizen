title: Interact with other sites
---

Denizen sites use the [Webmention protocol](TODO) to interact with other sites.
You can like, repost or reply to posts on other websites;
if those sites support the technology, your interactions will show up on the original post.

To create an interaction post, open the [big post editor](/about/posting#big-editor)
and choose one of the options at the top:

 * Reply
 * Like
 * Repost
 * Bookmark


##      Choose the target post

::: warn
**Warning:** Some features in this section are not yet implemented.
They have been struck out.

Choosing an interaction type will reveal extra options.
Enter the URL of the post you want to respond to into the target post field
(named "Reply to", "Like of", "Repost of" or "Bookmark of").

You can either copy the link of the post into the field,
<s>or start typing into the field to find the post by web search.</s>


##      Reply

You can reply to other people's posts.
These will show up on comments on compatible blogs.

If you tick the <kbd>Include reply context</kbd> checkbox,
Denizen will fetch the title and content of the post you're replying to
and show them on top of your post.


##      Like

Smash that like button.
The <kbd>Include in main feed</kbd> option will remove the post from your homepage by default --
you can untick it to let everyone know you liked the post.
Otherwise, the liked page will usually show your posts as part of a [facepile](TODO).


##      Repost

<s>You can share posts you like using the repost option.
This will copy the content of that post into yours.</s>


##      Bookmark

The bookmark feature is useful for [linkblogging].
Save a page you liked and add your notes into the post content.


##      Mention

In addition to interaction posts,
Denizen will notify the pages you link to in your post.
Some blogs display these as mentions.
