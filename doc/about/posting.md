To create your first post, you can use the [quick post box](#quick-post)
or the [big editor](#big-editor).


##      Quick post box {#quick-post}

The quick post box will appear at the top of your homepage
when you're [logged in](/about/login).

You can make small text posts by entering text into the box
and pressing <kbd>Post</kbd>.


##      Big editor {#big-editor}

For posts with titles, images and more, use the Big Editor.

You can get to the big editor using the <kbd>Open big editor</kbd>
link below the [quick post box](#quick-post).


###     Post type

You can select between the post types of
<kbd>Post</kbd>,
<kbd>Reply</kbd>,
<kbd>Like</kbd>,
<kbd>Repost</kbd> and
<kbd>Bookmark</kbd>,

This page will only discuss plain posts.
To learn about the other post types, see [interacting with other sites](/about/interact).


###     Title

You can enter a title for your post in the Title field.

Next to the Title field, there's the <kbd>More Fields</kbd> button (looks like â‹¯ this).
Pressing it will reveal the Summary and Language fields.


###     Summary

The Summary field serves as a preview or lede for your post.
It will be shown on the homepage below the title, as well as by search engines.


###     Language

The Language field is the language of your post.
Denizen will set this to the language of your site by default,
however, you can write posts in another language.

Selecting the correct language for your post is important
to help people find posts in their language,
and for users of assistive technology to be able to read them.


###     Content

::: warn
**Warning:** Some features in this section are not yet implemented.
These are struck out.
:::

You can write the body of your post as <s>formatted/"rich" text</s>,
plain text, <s>Markdown</s> or raw HTML.
You can choose this using the <kbd>Content type</kbd> menu below the content box.


###      Images

There are two ways to add an image to a post.

 * If the post consists entirely or mostly of images,
   use the <kbd>Add Image</kbd> entry to make an image post.
   The image will be shown above the post's text, if there is any.

 * To add an image in the middle of a post's content, drag and drop the image
   into the content box.
