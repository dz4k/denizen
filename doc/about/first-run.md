title: Accessing your site for the first time
---

After you [get your site up and running](/about/install),
the first time you open the website,
you'll be met by the "Welcome to Denizen" page.
In this page, you should set a password for your site,
as well as some basic details of your profile.


##      Blog name

Enter a name for your site. If you're setting up a personal site,
you'll probably want to put in your own name or a pseudonym.
This will be the title displayed on your homepage
as well as the "author" field on all your posts.

This is not a _username_, you won't use this to log in.


##      Site URL

This is the base URL that your site is on.
Denizen uses it to generate links and talk to other sites.
This field will populate itself.

If you haven't got a domain name yet, you should [update the site URL](/about/settings#site)
when you do.


##      Password

The password allows you to log in to your site,
which you'll need to do in order to
[post](/about/posting), [change your settings](/about/settings) or [edit your profile](/about/settings#profile).
Enter a secure password, and keep it safe --
there is no way to reset it.


##      Finish

Submit the form and your blog will be set up.
In order to make your first post or add more detail to your profile,
you'll need to [log in].
