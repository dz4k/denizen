After you [get your site up and running](/about/install),

you'll be met by the "Welcome to Denizen" page.
In this page, you should set a password for your site,
as well as some basic details of your profile.


##      Blog name

Enter a name for your site. If you're setting up a personal site,
you'll probably want to put in your own name or a pseudonym.
This will be the title displayed on your homepage
as well as the "author" field on all your posts.

This is not a _username_, you won't use this to log in.


##      Password

The password allows you to log in to your site,
which you'll need to do in order to [post], [change your settings] or [edit your profile].


##      Language

Select the language of your site.
Correctly labeling your website's language is important.
It helps people find materials in their language using search engines,
and is used by screen reader software to pronounce things correctly.

If you intend to post in multiple languages,
you can also [change the language for individual posts].


##      Finish

Submit the form and your blog will be set up.
In order to make your first post or add more detail to your profile,
you'll need to [log in].
