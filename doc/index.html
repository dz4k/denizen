<p> Denizen is written in JavaScript for Deno,
    and can be deployed on Deno Deploy &mdash;
    lowering the barrier of having a personal website
    without the limitations of static blog generators.

    <li>It comes with a post editor, so you can post from anywhere.
    <li>It supports Webmention (both receiving and sending)
        and ActivityPub, as well as on-site comments.
