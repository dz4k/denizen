    <p> Denizen is a <strong>pre-alpha work in progress</strong>.
        It lacks most of the features advertised here.
        You can see the progress on my
        <a href="https://codeberg.org/dz4k/denizen#todo">to-do list</a>.

<p> <strong>Denizen</strong> is <del>yet another blog CMS</del>
    a personal website engine that connects you
    to the <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a>
    with no configuration, no connection strings, and hopefully for free.
    Find it on
    <a href=https://codeberg.org/dz4k/denizen>Codeberg</a>.

<p> <strong><a href="/get-started/" class="unlink">&gt; Get started</a></strong>

<p> Denizen is written in JavaScript for Deno,
    and can be deployed on Deno Deploy or on any server &mdash;
    lowering the barrier of having a personal website
    without the limitations of static blog generators.
